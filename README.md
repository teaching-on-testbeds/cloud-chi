In this tutorial, we will explore some elements of cloud computing infrastructure using Chameleon, an OpenStack cloud (although the basic principles are common to all types of clouds).

- First, we will provision virtual machines, networks, and ports using the OpenStack GUI, Horizon. Then, we will practice using the CLI.
- We will use Docker to containerize a simple application and serve it from our cloud resources.
- Finally, we will install Kubernetes on our cluster, and use it to manage our containerized application.
