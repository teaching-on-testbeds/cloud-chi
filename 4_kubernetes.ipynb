    "## Deploy on Kubernetes\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we can deploy a service directly using a container, a container orchestration framework (like Kubernetes) will help us scale a deployment:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   If a container fails, Kubernetes can automatically detect it and replace it with a functional container.\n",
    "-   Kubernetes can deploy multiple instances of a container across several hosts, and balance the load across them.\n",
    "-   Kubernetes can automatically scale the deployment in response to load.\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this section:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   You should be able to deploy a Kubernetes cluster using `kubespray`\n",
    "-   You should be able to deploy a service in Kubernetes with multiple replicas for load balancing\n",
    "-   You should be able to use horizontal scaling to automatically adjust the number of replicas\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preliminaries\n",
    "\n",
    "This subsection involves running commands on the hosts in our cluster (node1, node2, and node3) by using SSH from the Chameleon JupyterHub environment, then running commands inside the SSH session.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the Chameleon JupyterHub environment, open three terminals:\n",
    "\n",
    "**SSH to node1**: In the first terminal, SSH to the node1 using the floating IP address assigned to it (substitute this IP for `A.B.C.D`):\n",
    "\n",
    "    ssh -A cc@A.B.C.D\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the `-A` argument - this is important. The `-A` allows us to “jump” from node1 to another node using the same key with which we authenticated to node1.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SSH to node2**: In the second terminal, run the following command (substitute the floating IP assigned to your node1 for `A.B.C.D`) to SSH to node2, but using node1 to “jump” there (since node2 does not have a floating IP assigned, we cannot SSH to it directly):\n",
    "\n",
    "    ssh -A -J cc@A.B.C.D cc@192.168.1.12\n",
    "\n",
    "**SSH to node3**: In the second terminal, run the following command (substitute the floating IP assigned to your node1 for `A.B.C.D`) to SSH to node3, but using node1 to “jump” there (since node3 does not have a floating IP assigned, we cannot SSH to it directly):\n",
    "\n",
    "    ssh -A -J cc@A.B.C.D cc@192.168.1.13\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use a project called `kubespray` to bring up a Kubernetes cluster on our three-node topology.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, though, we must:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   set up SSH login from the node1 host to all other hosts. It will use this SSH access during the installation and setup process.\n",
    "-   configure the firewall on all three nodes. Kubespray does not manage firewall rules for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll start with the SSH connections between hosts. On node1, we’ll generate a new keypair:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "# run on node1\n",
    "ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -q -N \"\" \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we copy that newly generated public key from node1 to the “authorized keys” list on each of the three nodes in the cluster (including node1 itself):\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "# run on node1\n",
    "ssh-copy-id -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub cc@192.168.1.11;\n",
    "ssh-copy-id -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub cc@192.168.1.12;\n",
    "ssh-copy-id -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub cc@192.168.1.13;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will disable the host-level firewall on all three nodes (we are still protected by the security groups we configured from the infrastructure provider):\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "# run on node1, node2, and node3\n",
    "sudo service firewalld stop\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We also need to remove the version of Docker we installed earlier on node1; `kubespray` will install a different version (one that is specifically known to work with the version of Kubernetes that it will deploy).\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "# run on node1\n",
    "sudo apt -y remove docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin;\n",
    "sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list; sudo apt update;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, on all three nodes, we will configure the Docker service (once it is installed again)\n",
    "\n",
    "-   to use a local “mirror” of DockerHub images on KVM@TACC, instead of pulling every image from the Internet. This will help us work around DockerHub rate limits on `docker pull` commands.\n",
    "-   and, to allow use of an insecure private Docker image registry that *we* will host ourselves, for our GourmetGram container images.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "# run on node1, node2, and node3\n",
    "sudo mkdir -p /etc/docker/\n",
    "sudo vim /etc/docker/daemon.json\n",
    "```\n",

    "Use `Esc` to get back in command mode, then `:wq` and hit Enter to save and quit the tet editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can close the SSH connections to node2 and node3 now; you’ll only need to run commands on node1 for the rest of this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prepare `kubespray`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we’ll download and set up `kubespray`, which will help us deploy our Kubernetes cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we get the source code and prepare a Python virtual environment in which to run it:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "# run on node1\n",
    "git clone --branch release-2.26 https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray\n",
    "sudo apt update; sudo apt -y install virtualenv\n",
    "virtualenv -p python3 myenv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We install prerequisite Python packages in this virtual environment\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "# run on node1\n",
    "source myenv/bin/activate;  cd kubespray;   pip3 install -r requirements.txt; pip3 install ruamel.yaml; \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We copy over a sample “cluster inventory” provided by `kubespray`, and make a couple of change to the configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   we select `docker` as the container manager\n",
    "-   and we enable the metrics server, which we will use for automatic scaling of our deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "# run on node1\n",
    "cd; mv kubespray/inventory/sample kubespray/inventory/mycluster;\n",
    "sed -i \"s/container_manager: containerd/container_manager: docker/\" kubespray/inventory/mycluster/group_vars/k8s_cluster/k8s-cluster.yml;\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we use an “inventory builder” script to describe the configuration of our desired cluster. We define the list of IP addresses of the nodes that will be included in the cluster, then let the automatic inventory builder create our configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "# run on node1\n",
    "cd; source myenv/bin/activate;  cd kubespray;  \n",
    "declare -a IPS=(192.168.1.11 192.168.1.12 192.168.1.13);\n",
    "CONFIG_FILE=inventory/mycluster/hosts.yaml python3 contrib/inventory_builder/inventory.py ${IPS[@]};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can look at the configuration we will deploy, and make sure everything looks as expected:\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install Kubernetes\n",
    "\n",
    "We’re ready for the installation step! This will take a while, so you can start it and then step away for a half hour or so.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you get interrupted, you can just re-connect to node1 and then run the command below again.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "# run on node1    \n",
    "cd; source myenv/bin/activate; cd kubespray; ansible-playbook -i inventory/mycluster/hosts.yaml  --become --become-user=root cluster.yml\n",

To address this, we can use scaling - where the resource deployment changes in response to load on the service. In this example, specifically we use horizontal scaling, which adds more pods/replicas to handle increasing levels of work, and removes pods when they are not needed.
